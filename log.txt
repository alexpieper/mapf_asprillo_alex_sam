Setup
	- 4x4 grid and then get fancier if necessary
	- fuse 4-connected neighbors into one abstracted cell
Questions:
	- name of abstracted cells?
	- how to specify the abstractions?
	- how to deal with time from abstracted solution to the original grid?
	- groups of 2x2 don't work when width%2 != 0 or height%2 != 0. What to do with remaining rows/cols?
